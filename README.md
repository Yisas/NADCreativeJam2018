This was a game jam in which the participants where required to develop a game in 46 hours, while adhering to the overall theme of "Memory", and the technical challenge of including a "Buddy AI".

This entry is named "Pipe Dream", a 2D platformer with mixed 3D elements and an added resource management component. In this game you will travel through the semi-ruined dreamscape of a pipe world, in which you and your friendly drone will collect stray memories scattered throughout the world. Yet things are not simple as they seem, as some memories carry traumatic experiences which will grant you phobias towards certain game actions, like jumping near a ledge or climbing a wall for fear of falling to your death. Luckily, your character is a robot that can choose to wipe its own memory in the event of crippling terror, however, not all memories are negative, and positive memories will cancel out negative ones. The objective is to carry as many positive memories to the finish line as possible. Manage your memories as you traverse this 2D platformer, and escape with as sane a mind as you can.
